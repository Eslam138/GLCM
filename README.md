# GLCM
Design a texture classifier model using
-Flickr Material Database (FMD) dataset:
https://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/CVPR2010/FMD/
“The FMD dataset was constructed with the specific purpose of capturing a range of real
world appearances of common materials include: fabric, foliage, glass, leather, metal, paper,
plastic, stone, water, and wood. In this database 100 images (in each category, 50 close-ups
and 50 regular views) per category, 10 categories “. Train using 70% od the data, test using
30%
-GLCM with different texture features
(You can use graycomatrix, graycoprops functions from scikit-image library )
- KNN classifier (with k=1)
-Report your accuracy
